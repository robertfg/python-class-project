# New York Mets Improvement Project
Code Louisville Python Project July 2019

## Background
The `New York Mets` are a National League baseball team.  They are perenially bad and I am a frustrated fan looking for ways to improve the club.

## Question
Is there one area where the `New York Mets` can look to improve the most?  Where would the `Mets` get the most bang for their buck?

## Overview

### Data Source
Baseball Databank is a compilation of historical baseball data in a convenient, tidy format, distributed under Open Data terms, which I found on `kaggle.com`.  Most of the data in the Databank is provided by Chadwick Baseball Bureau (http://www.chadwick-bureau.com).

From this data, I used a subset of the files:

* Batting.csv
* Fielding.csv
* FieldingOFsplit.csv
* People.csv
* Pitching.csv
* Teams.csv

### Analysis
The `Mets` starting pitching was well above league average; however, their relief pitching was below average.  They didn't hit well either, but if they could only improve their bullpen they would be a much better club.
