# New York Mets Improvement Project
Code Louisville Python Project July 2019

## Question
How can the New York Mets improve?

## Background
The New York Mets are a National League baseball team.  They are perenially bad and I am a frustrated fan looking for ways to improve the club.

## Overview

### Data Source
Baseball Databank is a compilation of historical baseball data in a convenient, tidy format, distributed under Open Data terms, which I found on `kaggle.com`.  Most of the data in the Databank is provided by Chadwick Baseball Bureau (http://www.chadwick-bureau.com).

From this data, I used a subset of the files:

* Batting.csv
* Fielding.csv
* FieldingOFsplit.csv
* People.csv
* Pitching.csv
* Teams.csv
